I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This workshop is mainly about inheriting derived class from base class, 
shadowing base class member functions, and interactions between base class 
and derived class. I did not encounter too much trouble completing this workshop,
here are some points I want to remind myself about this workshop:

1.
about constructor and destructor about derived class, when creating an object of a 
derived class, constructor of base class will be invoked first, then constructor of
the derived class will then be invoked, but for destructor it is the opposite, the 
derived class' destructor will be invoked before base class. Note the difference with 
creating and object of another class(say class A) inside an object of current class
(class B), class B's constructor will be invoked first then class A, and class A's 
destructor will be invoked before class B's.

2.
even though we use public inheritance when creating derived class, note that we still
cannot access private members of the base class, public inheritance means that public 
members of base class will be public for the derived class, protected and private 
members will remain its access specifiers in the derived class. That means we will not 
be able to access private members from base class even though the inheritance is public.
