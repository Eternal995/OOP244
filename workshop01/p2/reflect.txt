I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This workshop is consist of review of ipc144 file operations and the using of namespace.
In both part of the workshop we are suppose to declare variables and functions inside the 
namespace (sdds for part 1 and quizzer for part 2), by doing so it makes the functions in 
namespace easy to reuse for further projects, without causing naming conflicts. 

For part 2 of this workshop, I spent most the time trying to figure out how to properly read
from the txt files. in the beginning I try to everything separated, then I run into the trouble
when reading the answer bodies, when I tried to read if there's a space or X in between the parentheses
, I used fscanf(file, "[%1s], ...) to try to read if it is a space or X, but it turns out cannot read
any spaces, to after trying different ways, I can only do fscanf(file, "%[^\n]\n", ...) to read the entire
line and then read the character that respond to the space or X to determine if the answer is correct.

other than that, I think it is a straight forward workshop, I first think I will need to create a 
Question structure inside the main function and pass it into any functions for modification, but 
turns out I can just declare it in global scope and just use and reuse it. After successfully reading
everything from txt files, I just finished the provided function prototypes, and compile and see the
results to make some small fixes.
