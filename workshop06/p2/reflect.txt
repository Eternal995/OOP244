I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This workshop is mainly focusing on the copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
It is a straight forward concept and this workshop does not cause a lot problem.
some details with this workshop:

1.
both part of the workshop involves overloading of operator +=, and thus needed to 
add item to allocated dynamic memory, as the code showing:

        Fruit *temp = nullptr;
        temp = new Fruit[m_cnt + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < m_cnt; i++) {
            strcpy(temp[i].m_name, m_fruits[i].m_name);
            temp[i].m_qty = m_fruits[i].m_qty;
        }

        strcpy(temp[m_cnt].m_name, fruit.m_name);
        temp[m_cnt].m_qty = fruit.m_qty;

        delete[] m_fruits;

        m_fruits = temp;
        temp = nullptr;

the way to do it is by creating a temp point and assignment one more object than
the original memory and copy old data into new memory, then delete the old 
allocated memory and change the pointer to pointing to the new allocated array.

2.
the main difference between copy constructor and copy assignment operator is that 
for the copy assignment operator, we need to consider the situation that 
the pointer is already pointing to some dynamically allocated memory, so 
need to consider delete those before allocating new memory, as code shows:

if (m_fruits != nullptr) {
    delete[] m_fruits;
    m_fruits = nullptr;
}
