my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This workshop is focusing on class type, using and creating member functions, 
and how member functions are interacting with members in a class object(i.e querying
and modifying). The concepts are fairly straight forward and the only problem I 
encounter in this workshop is:

1. 
in the bar module, when I write the set() member function, since I am need to allocate
dynamic memory for the title of the bar, so I tried to check if the title pointer
is already pointing to some string already and if so I would like to deallocate 
first. So what I do is:

    if (title != nullptr)
        reset();

by checking if title is already pointing to something before I reset, then I ran into
problem that when the bar object is created in barTester.cpp, it is not initialized
and the title pointer is not nullptr and is not pointing to anywhere, so it is containing
some garbage data, so it go through the reset() function, it has nothing to delete 
so I run into some error, the only way I can solve this is by creating constructor
that can initialize the title to nullptr. I don't know if there's any other way I can
check if a pointer is already pointing to some dynamically allocated memory.
