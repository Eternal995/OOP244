my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This workshop is continuing working on derived functions and virtual functions.
Overall it is a straight forward workshop and I did not encounter too much problem.

Biggest trouble I had with this workshop was:
I was able to read all the names from file, but while sorting and other things are 
working fine, I was not able to print out the names for simpson's family, 
After reading through operator== function in main.cpp and some testing I found that
when I read last name the string will end with an extra space, which caused the 
last to be different from 'Simpson', I fixed it by changing getline in the read method
to get and it solves the problem, which I don't know why.
