I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This Workshop is focusing mainly on operator overloading, most concepts are 
straight forward, not much problems are encountered during this workshop, 
some minor problems are:

1.
the insertion and extraction operator overloading that not involving iostream 
is confusing, I cannot find any examples that doing these overloading without
using istream& or ostream&, so what I initially tried is:

    Hero &operator<<(Hero &hero, Power &power);

that's copying from:

    std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, const Hero &hero);

but the output type is confusing, and in the workshop5 readme.md it is under 
boolean helper operators, but if output type is boolean is also confusing.
So after reviewing main.cpp code I can only use:

    void operator<<(Hero &hero, Power &power);

I don't know which is the correct approach since both are working correctly.

2.
some minor confusion about the this pointer, 
I initially found that *this++ is not working from part 1 of the workshop 
so what I wrote is:

        Book temp = *this;
        temp++;
        *this = temp;

Then after submitting I tested out that (*this)++ is working fine. I'm guessing 
the priority of running is the postfix happens before dereferencing so I need to 
parentheses the dereferencing part before ++;
